ONe major to do is to create / setup the database in firebase

TODO is to clone download nodejs and clone the repo
this will write our data model for us 
we will adjust later with time

Furthernmore we need to copy and paste routes, themes , and the folders within EXCEPT MODELS OFC
models will be created using json_serializable after the data model is created

1.  
    -create data model
        -nodejs script
        -or create it manually
2. 
    - Copy and paste the basic files and change the imports accordingly CTRL+F and remove studyapp ofc
    -NO MODELS
3.
    - work on json serializable models files
    -make sure data is fetching from the database after this
    -then BE SURE That it is writing to firestore
It is not a bad idea to create the data model with the code then boom 


HEY change the color and fontweight of the quiz title in the quiz selection screen.   !!!!

Ok npm and nodejs are installed
go to project settings service accounts and try to figure it out there how to put your service account key into credentials.json
